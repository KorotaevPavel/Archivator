The sample code included with this article (see Downloads) was written in Eclipse 3.1 using the C Development Tooling (CDT); the getopt_demo and getopt_long_demo projects are Managed Make projects, which are built using the CDT's program-generation rules. You won't find a Makefile in the project, but it's so trivial that you'll have no trouble generating one if you need to compile the code outside of Eclipse.
